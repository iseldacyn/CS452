Iselda Aiello

The given object is: a Moai statue!
I implented both an angle-based point light (light 1) and distance-based point light (light 2). Light 1 is supposed to mimic a flashlight, as if the statue is going to tell a spooy story around a campfire, while light 2 aims to mimic a Sun shining down on the statue.
