My primary resources for this lab were referencing the notes from class, specifically for RotatingSquare and TranformingSquare. Most of my code for performing every operation in this lab came from class, including those for rotations, translations, mouse click events, key press events, and button events.
The hardest part was putting it all together into one file, however it was not too difficult. For the buttons, I made two functions for the different functionalities of the buttons and passed in parameters on each button press. I made it so "Increase" and "Decrease" would increase/decrease a speed parameter which would be used in the translation matrix to speed up the polygons movement. Similarly, the "Start Rotation" and "Stop Rotation" buttons would set a flag as either 1 or 0 to determine whether the shape would rotate or not (and thus, keep its rotation upon halting).
For the key presses, I made flags for the X and Y directions which would activate upon pressing "a", "d", "s", or "w" and determine the polygons direction of motion.
The mouse click was the hardest part to implement, as it was mostly just code from the class, however the polygon would keep moving in a direction and maintain its offset from the origin when clicking the mouse. To correct this, I reset tx and ty to 0 in order to ensure the polygon had no offset and would completely reset its position to the point where the mouse was pressed on the canvas.
