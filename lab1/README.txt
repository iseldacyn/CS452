My initial idea for this lab was to create a popular childhood drawing scene of a house with the sun in the corner. I used the examples from class to set up my project, and as a template for how to initialize my project. I then drew out a sketch of what my scene will look like, including finding the coordinates for each vertex on each shape.`
My first two shapes I created are supposed to represent the house with a roof. The frame of the house was created with a line loop, and makes a hexagon shape with a rectangle pushing into it to represent a doorway. The roof is a strange triangle shape I came up with to be implemented using a triangle strip. My final shape is an ellipse, which uses it's parametric formula to calculate all the points making up the edge of the shape, similar to the method used for a circle in class.

I had one final comment- since each shape should be a different color, but one should have been drawn with a line loop, is it okay I just made it black as to have the background fill it in (and to have it serve more as an "outline" for the shape, rather than the colored-in shape itself)?
